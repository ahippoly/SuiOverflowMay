SuiSafe is the web wallet with the smoothest UX in the Sui ecosystem, ideal for onboarding users on consumer dApps.

Leveraging the zkLogin primitive, during onboarding, users are offered to link more than one social account to ensure smooth recovery and protection from hacks.

As a Web wallet, your users can onboard your dApp with the user journey they already know without downloading any extension or mobile app wallet.

Try it on https://www.sui-safe.com/ or run it locally.

To run it locally, go to StashWallet, set up your credentials as in the .env.example, and run pnpm install.

A dApp to test the product is in the folder DappTest
